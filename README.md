# Fair Course Registration System
This repository contains codes, presentation slides, and documentation files for 2021 Fall CS489 Project.

## Project Description
At KAIST, we register our courses using random course registration systems. However, randomness make inevitable situations where  students fail to take the compulsory lectures for graduation or miss the courses that they really want to take. However, the random system does not only engenders inconvenience, but also the ethical issues like buying or selling their course slots and using macro programs. A more complex program is necessary.

Thus, this CS489 project is about a more **fair course registration system**. In this project, we will first simulate current registration situations happening at KAIST every semester. We will simulate the currently provided courses in all sorts: competitive and non-competitive in terms of capacity, compulsory or elective, basics or graduate-levels. Next, we will simulate students' desired course timetable based on real data. We hope to get some data on studentsâ€™ initial preference on courses from course registration office at KAIST, but if not, we will simulate the student entities with qualitative surveys.

For more details, see the [project proposal slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MvKQQvWTKKgcyD6869hr5r5vR4arvo9qF2p6UIif7Fk/edit?usp=sharing). This slides were presented on November 1st.
